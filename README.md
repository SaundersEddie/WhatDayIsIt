# Future

There are some bugs that are in the queue to being resolved, such as the validation of month entry, right now a user could use the API call to push Jan-99 to the database.  
Change displayed results so the first character of each record returned is capitailized.
Much cleanup needed of the display, in case anyone hadn't guessed, I'm not really an artist type. :)
